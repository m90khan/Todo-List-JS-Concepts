Topic: Software Engineering

- SE is an process of combining tools, methods and standard operations to product quality softwares within given constraints.

* Software Process: 
- Breaking down the software complexity into systematic smaller pieces
- using formal techniques on how will the software will be developed.

* FOUR SOFTWARE PROCESSES
- WATERFALL : one phase to the other , follows the flow
- Evolutionary Prototyping: start with intial and develop based on customer feedback
- Unified Software Process: heavily based on UML
- AGILE: flexible in development, changes in requirements

Topic: Software Phases
- Requirements Engineering
- Design (High level Structure)
- Implementation
- Verification and Validation
- Maintanenece

* Tools
- IDE, VCS (GIT) , Coverage and Verification Tools

* Software Lifecycle
- Software Lifecycle : sequence of decisions that determine the history of your software
- There are many models in which you can make decisions that better fulfill requirments. 

* Requirments Engineering : iterative process
- RE is the process of establishing the needs of stakeholders that are to be solved by software

-1- Elicitation: Colelction of reuirments from stakeholders
-2- Analysis: deeper understanding of requirments
-3- Specification: REQ are organized so to be shared
-4- Validation: validate reqs, that they are complete, consistent, non-redundant
-5- Management: Accounts of changes to the requirments during the entire development process

* Software Design
- software requirements are analyses to describe the inner structure of the organization 
- the description will server as a basis of teh actual system. has series of design phases.

- Architectural Design -> Abstract Specification -> Interface Design
-> Component Design -> Data Structure -> Algorithm Design
-(we go from high level design system to a low-level)

* Implementation
- Realize the design system and proceed with implementation

- Reduction of Complexity
- Anticipation of Diversity: to anticipate that Software could change during ddevelopment
- Structure Validation: easy testable software
- agrees with internal or external standards


* Validation and Verification
- validation the system concurrent with requirments
- verification: is the developed software is correctly build
